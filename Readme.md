Methods
Applied time series analysis to predict the volume of calls per hour. I used three different models, including ARIMA, Facebook Prophet, and ETS, to make predictions. Also conducted data exploration to see patterns or trends in the volume of calls and to see the most common complaints, agency responsible for dealing with complaints, time to solve a complaint, borough, and neighborhood.

Results
The analysis showed that the Facebook Prophet model performed the best in predicting the volume of calls per hour. I also found that the most common complaints were related to noise, heat/hot water, and street conditions. The agency responsible for handling the most complaints was the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, and the average time to resolve a complaint was 8.5 days. 

Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into the volume of calls to the 311 call center in New York City and the most common complaints and agencies responsible for handling them. The results can be used to improve the efficiency of the call center and to address the most common complaints more effectively.
